# Elevator-module-for-Linux
An elevator that runs in the background of Linux

This project adds an elevator module to your linux kernel.
The module uses custom system calls that must be added to your kernel first.
You must go through the steps of adding system calls for this project to work.
This includes recompiling the kernel.

The code and makefile for the system calls are included in SystemCalls
The code for the modules, the elevator code, and the makefile are included in SyscallModule
